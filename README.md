# Women's safety route finder
The “Women’s Safety Route Finder” is designed to help users navigate by considering multiple safety constraints alongside traditional route metrics like distance.
The programme uses a hardcoded dataset to simulate locations and roads, with attributes such as lighting, crowd density, CCTV presence, crime rate,etc. 
The system adjusts route computations based on user inputs on mode of transport or custom safety weight options, to prioritize safety and efficiency.
