# Women's safety route finder #
!!!! This is a Proof of Concept  !!!!
This project was built to demonstrate the idea of a route planner emphasising safety. It is not a functional safety application and can not be used for real world navigation.
The system uses a small, simulated dataset for demonstration purposes. To become a real product, it would need to be integrated with live, verified data from police departments,Google Maps API or similar API integrations for city infrastructure maps,  real-time traffic services etc.

Find Your Safest Way Home: A Route Planner That Puts Your Safety First
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Ever feel nervous walking home at night? Or find yourself wondering which route has better lighting? This project is a proof of concept for a route planner designed with women's safety as its top priority.It goes beyond just finding the shortest or fastest path. Instead, it demonstrates how a system could analyse routes based on real world safety factors like street lighting, CCTV coverage,  crowd density etc to find a path you can feel more confident about.
